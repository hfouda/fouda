The West is dead\
No more unsettled lands\
Expendable hands\
Seek no glory in foreign wars\
Skin crumbles with too many scars\
Imaginary homelands await the well-armed\
Deep in your brain lie American dreams\
Of education turned to golden streams\
All that is forbidden is permitted\
Inequality constitutionally mandated\
The west is indefinitely dead\
Soon the imaginary country lifts its head
