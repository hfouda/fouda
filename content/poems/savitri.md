There are a rare flowers \
That need no showers \
To glow at midnight \
And shine in daylight

They have discovered a way \
To cast expectations away \
They are similar to the pearl \
Savitri the mythological girl \
Who won back husbandâ€™s breath \
By outthinking the god of death

Resourceful and determined \
You seem to be predestined \
Without doubt to be happy \
As much as one can be \
Remember the price of peace \
However is that inequities cease
