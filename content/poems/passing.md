I left my small town at dawn \
rolling a cardboard suitcase \
When I reach New York \
I will reinvent myself as Portuguese \
Maybe better off an Arab Princess \
a mysterious Armenian \
A daughter of Rome sounds right \
I want to model a lady precisely \
I am tired of being redlined \
I am an immigrant today \
My children will be citizens \
I know I will be submerged at the end \
It will be on these shores \
But after I am gone \
my sickle cells will be carried by all \
a defense against climate change \
the only token of my double life \
our genes proof that Neanderthals were neighbors then
