After a storm... it is calm \
Earthquakes end in quivers \
Great waves break into wavelets \
Even thunder muffles \
From chaos to quiet nature repairs

After the storm it is...calm  \
We rock babies on our backs \
Rather than haul cotton in large sacks  \
Wallow on the beach when we please \
Our fury appeased

After the storm it is...calm \
We ride carriages without fear \
Set prisoners free everywhere \
Restore ghost limbs concealed  \
Reparations settled
