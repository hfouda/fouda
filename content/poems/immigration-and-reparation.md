North, South, East and West \
Women, men and kids in Sunday best \
hopes high for better lives \
plot right away for their beehives  \
The land is vast the buildings tall \
Trains long and warehouses full \
No more short lives  \
In a day you can have a year \
if you can digest quick  \
This is the promised land  \
a ghost mumbles \
Thousands of days I have worked hard \
Happy or not it does not matter  \
the fruit was taken \
So much is unfair  \
I seek justice even when it hurts
