_Something specifically local: a sudden change in Wellesley's weather last fall._

Five little birds \
Five little birds radiant like a rainbow \
Under one December sun warm glow \
The evergreen are their usual color \
Surprisingly the lawn is still green \
Lingering fall against winter pallor \
The Indian summer as seldom seen \
But suddenly hovering dark clouds \
A northeaster restoring order \
The five birds take their hullabaloo into a bush \
They sing through the storm maybe until death \
Sometimes I wonder if the birds are me \
It is so strange I feel like they are kin \
They are caught in a storm \
Dreaming of a distant sunny kingdom \
With only songs to sustain their longing
