When you are dark you are really blue \
On sunny days you are shadow through tinted shades \
Day or night, invisible, \
existence wished away \
They will kneel on your neck, steal your breath, \
shoot through your door as you dream \
They refuse to see you, boy or man \
Suddenly a toy is a dagger through a motherâ€™s heart \
Your shadow crosses theirs in the middle of the day \
and you end up face down, lifeless \
Protests followed by investigations lead to lawsuits \
Nothing seems to change \
When you are Black you are roadkill on an American highway!
