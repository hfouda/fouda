_Shameful Trades is a poem in postmodern form for reprehensible acts as old as this country._

@God help me understand your intent \
“A valuable Negro woman” \
“Accustomed to all kinds of housework” \
“Is a good plain cook “ \
“And excellent dairy maid” \
“Washes and irons” \
@God this woman is absolutely competent \
“She has four children” \
“One a girl about 13 years of age another 7” \
“A boy 5 and an infant 11 months old” \
“Two of the children will be sold with mother” \
“The others separately if it best suit the purchaser” \
@God can’t you read? This is a abhorrent
