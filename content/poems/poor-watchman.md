I saw our watchman today \
Dressed in gentleman garb \
Wig askance on his head \
A crowd of negroes in toes \
He can now reproduce \
Without needing to seduce \
Such is the privilege \
Bestowed to gunmen here \
Who hunger for Indian land \
Over perilous oceans \
Yet farms need more hands \
So, children call him Massa \
Sundays he holds the Bible upside down \
Sings hymns he will never understand
