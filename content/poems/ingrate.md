I bathe in warm sun’s rays-- \
a wake-up light from Africa-- \
sooth my skin after a cold night  \
I ruminative on my gurney  \
No need to rush off the sweet caress \
Again, I long for Bimbia  \
hear the watchman’s voice,  \
Get up lazy negroes  \
I grow your food Summers to Springs \
Prepare your meals in delirium \
Feed your kids while you drink Rhum \
Your house stands tall thanks to my labor \
You are ensnared in my welfare strings \
thrive on others’ pain \
assert full claim on my grind \
Were your guns to stop firing  \
I would run from cold sunsets \
I take comfort  \
in the fear paralyzing your heart \
Every mind is hidden and alert
