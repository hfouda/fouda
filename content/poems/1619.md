1619 and [1619 Echo]({{< ref "/poems/1619-echo" >}} "1619 Echo") are twin poems.

I saw a bird today, eastward bound \
I started to long for our homeland \
Fly me home, I pled in silence \
To bypass a guard hovering around \
My feeble prayer ended up in queue \
God is ever busy sorting wishes \
The land is cold like hailstones \
Hearts are pressed into hard stones \
Days grow shorter and nights longer \
The sun appears from time to time \
The moon is revealed now and then \
That is how I know I am still alive \
Dare I sing I am not doomed yet? \
That is how I know I may survive
