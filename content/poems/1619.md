1619 and [1619 Echo]({{< ref "/poems/1619-echo" >}} "1619 Echo") are twin poems.

I was a bird today, eastward bound \
I longed for my homeland \
Flying home, I pled in silence \
To bypass a guard hovering around \
My feeble prayer ended up in queue \
God is ever sorting wishes

The land is cold like hailstones \
Hearts are pressed to hard stones \
Days grow short and nights long \
The sun appears from time to time \
The moon reveals from now to then

That is how I know I am still alive \
That is how I know I may survive
