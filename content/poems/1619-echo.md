[1619]({{< ref "/poems/1619" >}} "1619") and 1619 Echo are twin poems.

_The echo is the wailing of the mother vowing to stay alive until the daughter is back._

I ran around for days, \
looking for you between the rays. \
Nowhere to find you. Did you elope? \
Nine days later the village lost hope \
except for me, your poor mother, \
who won’t believe you are gone forever. \
Talking drums declare you captive. \
Never our warriors are more active. \
Running after the sun the mission, \
I follow them crawling to exhaustion, \
then wake up to the thump of a drum— \
water stole the fruit of my womb.

I hear sea water flows to the sky; \
do not fear it, you will not die. \
No burial for me until you are back. \
I will return a ghost in the dark, \
unable to speak but recording every scene, \
the destruction visited upon us obscene. \
Your homeland has turned to wasteland. \
I dare not cross the river until I understand.

It will be a long time before I visit your dreams.
