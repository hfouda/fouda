[1619]({{< ref "/poems/1619" >}} "1619") and 1619 Echo are twin poems.

_The echo is the wailing of the mother vowing to stay alive until the daughter is back._

I ran around for many days \
Looking for you with all the rays \
Nowhere to find you did you elope \
Nine days later the village lost hope \
Except for me your poor mother \
Who canâ€™t believe you gone forever \
As I was wallowing in excoriating pain \
A message came from a relay chain \
Talking drums declaring you captive \
Never our warriors were more active \
Running after the sun was the mission \
I followed them crawling to exhaustion \
Then waking up to the thump of a drum \
Saying water stole the fruit of my womb \
I heard sea is water flowing into the sky \
Do not be afraid of it you can never die \
I vow no burial for me until you are back \
I will hover around a ghost in the dark \
Unable to speak but recording every scene \
The destruction visited upon us is obscene \
Your homeland is turning into a wasteland \
I dare not cross the river until I understand \
It will be a long time before I visit your dreams
