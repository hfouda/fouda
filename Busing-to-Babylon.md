We are consigned to hoods\
The only home we know,\
Beatdown, true, familiar.\
\
Grandmothers sit near windows,\
Watch over their lively broods,\
Over basketball games on parking yards,\
\
Pickup baseball set on back alleys,\
Until some window shatters--\
This is where we live and die.\
\
Sunday mornings streets turn quiet\
The reverend delivers gospel to\
Men on their best behavior\
And aunts in their best Sunday hats\
The church is where all are taxed.\
\
Children bundled up Monday to Friday\
In yellow buses heading to the highway\
Their parents apprehensive but hopeful\
Exile in Babylon helps to reveal books,\
Demystifies the minds behind the masks
