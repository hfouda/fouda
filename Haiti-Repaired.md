I remember you\
Emerald Island\
\
Happy Taino frolicking on golden beaches\
Columbus spread European strains\
\
Taino villages depleted as old mines\
Unwilling Africans captives in absurd plans\
\
I remember the chant\
God does not die so we cannot die\
\
Fairy tales last only in books\
Liberté Égalité Fraternité are conditional\
\
Haiti learns\
Hard currency paid to France\
\
The emerald island has no more trees\
Poverty still kills the land
