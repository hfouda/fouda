You call it with reverence law enforcement.\
I experience it as violation of my body,\
\
defiled with unjustified force,\
rules divide into castes.\
\
I am the untouchable,\
ignored by the Constitution, codex of this land.\
\
A phantom system grades humans \
incidental or consequential.\
\
Someday,\
my body, the sacred vessel of my life,\
\
will be sanctified in law and custom,\
insured of common ascent.
