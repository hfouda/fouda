This poem, if conscious, would thank me\
for the gift of awareness.\
Consciousness is extraordinary.\
\
I will never presume to get this poem fully.\
I will write other poems,\
So this poem never walks alone.\
\
That is why I am here,\
To validate joys,\
To validate pains.\
 \
Only I understand.\
Free and conscious,\
I honor this gift with hope.
