They are the Black Madonnas\
Housed in churches of Europe,\
Incandescent shrines\
Where pilgrims burn away bothering sins,\
Repair broken bodied souls.\
\
The dark statues channel miracles\
From Mary and her son\
Sacrificed so that they can see light\
In the New World.\
\
Echoes of the risen are not confined in shrines\
They are flesh, blood, bones and tears,\
Dark skinned priestesses carrying spears,\
Whose sons have been taken away.\
\
Black Madonnas atone for our lapses.\
They cook breakfast then pluck cocks,\
Iron bedsheets, stitch socks.\
\
With open eyes they steal reading,\
Charcoal in hand they learn writing,\
Disguised in men lead captives to freedom,\
Eyes focused on a just kingdom.
